**Project Title:** Sentiment Analysis for Real Estate Property Reviews

**Project Description:**

In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis system to evaluate customer reviews for real estate properties. The primary goal was to determine whether a property is worthy of purchase or disputable based on customer sentiments expressed in the reviews. This project involved several key components, including text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and data visualization.

**Key Components:**

1. Text Preprocessing:
   - **Tokenization:** I used the NLTK library to tokenize the text into individual words.
   - **Lowercasing and Punctuation Removal:** The text was converted to lowercase, and all punctuation was removed to standardize the data.
   - **Stopwords Removal:** Common English stopwords were removed to focus on the meaningful words in the reviews.
   - **Lemmatization:** Words were lemmatized using the WordNetLemmatizer to reduce them to their base forms.

2. Sentiment Analysis:
   - I employed the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool from the NLTK library to analyze the polarity of the reviews.
   - Sentiments were categorized into three classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral, based on the compound sentiment score.

3. Data Visualization:
   - I utilized the matplotlib library to visualize the sentiment distribution of the reviews.
   - The results were plotted in a bar chart, showing the count of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Project Implementation:

- **Data Source:** The reviews were stored in a text file named `real_estate_reviews.txt`, where each review was separated by two newline characters.
- **Sentiment Classification:** The sentiment of each review was classified, and the overall sentiment distribution was counted and visualized.
- **Decision Criteria:** Based on the sentiment analysis results, a property was deemed "worthy of purchase" if the majority of reviews were positive, and "disputable" if the majority were negative or neutral.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrated the application of natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques to a real-world problem in the real estate domain. By automating the sentiment analysis of property reviews, potential buyers can make more informed decisions. Additionally, real estate agents and property developers can gain valuable insights into customer opinions and areas for improvement.
